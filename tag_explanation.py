"""
This script explains the XML tag issue.

The issue was that we were trying to replace <n> tags with <Name> tags,
but the XSLT transformation was expecting <n> tags. The input XML files
were already using <n> tags, so no replacement was needed.

However, our AI assistant displayed tags differently in the code than
what was actually in the files, causing confusion about what tags were
being used.
